# Billing

Billing in balenaCloud is managed through [organizations][organizations]. To manage billing for a specific organization, navigate to the organization and select the `Billing` tab from the sidebar on the left:

From this dashboard, you can change your billing plan, update your billing information, monitor your usage, and download invoices. If you have any questions about billing for your account, please contact [our customer success team][solutions].

## Changing your billing plan

To modify or upgrade your billing plan, click the "Change plan" button on the billing page:

Select the plan you'd like to upgrade to from the list of available options:

Enter your billing information and complete the signup process:

If you need to downgrade or cancel your plan, you can follow the steps mentioned above by choosing a lower tier or free plan instead.  

Certain plan levels and custom plans may require you to contact our customer success team in order to complete an upgrade or downgrade. If you find yourself in this situation, please contact [our customer success team][solutions]. 

## Account settings and usage

At the top of the billing page, you'll find a summary of your subscription with information on the total amount and due date for your next payment:

Beneath this you can see your current usage, including [active devices][inactive] and collaborators:

Further down, you'll find a place to download invoices, add or edit payment methods, and update account information:

At the bottom of this page, you'll find more information on the available [plans][plans], and you can change plans as necessary.

## Dynamic billing

Any usage above what is included in your current billing plan will be tracked and billed dynamically in arrears. Dynamic billing will occur every month, even for those on annual plans.

For both devices and users, usage is calculated based on the maximum number in your account at any point during the month. **This includes all [active devices][inactive], whether online or offline.**

As an example, let's say you are on the Pilot plan, which includes up to 50 devices and 3 users. In one month, your active device count steadily climbs from 43 to 52. During this same month, you temporarily increase your user count from 3 to 4, before returning it to 3 at the end of the month. Based on this usage, your dynamic billing charges for the month will include an additional 2 devices and 1 user.

Furthermore, we charge a device or user only once for the most feature-rich usage tier within the same billing period. For example, a user was assigned a Developer role for the first half of the billing period and was later reassigned the Operator role for the second half of the billing period. In this scenario, we would charge the usage as a Developer role for the entire billing period. This is because the Developer role is a more feature-rich usage tier than the Operator role, as seen in [fleet membership types][fleet-membership-types]. It's important to note that we are not double charging for the same user.

Charges for usage outside your plan will show up under the *Add-ons* section of your invoice. If you prefer, you can still contact us to pre-purchase devices and users and have them added to your plan, rather than be automatically billed in arrears for additional devices and users.

## Inactive devices

If you have devices that will be inactive for long periods of time, you can mark them as `Inactive`. This will keep them from being counted towards your device total. Weâ€™ll charge a one-time deactivation fee, and the devices will remain inactive until they come online.

Marking a device as `Inactive` is a [device action][device-action]. Device actions can be applied in one of three ways: as a group action applied to one or more devices in the device list, as an action selected from the dropdown on the device dashboard, or directly from the *Actions* tab of the device dashboard. Once a device has been marked `Inactive`, it will be faded out in the device list.

## Inactive vs Offline Devices

To understand the difference between Inactive and Offline, we define them the following way:

- Inactive: The device has been deactivated, or has been preregistered but has not yet connected to the balenaCloud API.
- Offline: The device is not connected to cloudlink and has not had any recent API communications.

If you have a device offline _and_ active you **will still be billed for that device.** Those devices are usually still deployed in the field and ready to be used at any time. If you make the decision to have your devices offline intentionally, you will still see them in your fleet and and can take some actions, such as applying updates, that will take effect as soon as they come online.

Once you deactivate a device, you will not be able to monitor nor to apply updates to it, and you won't be charged after the de-activation fee until they become online again.
